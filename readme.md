#NashFP polyglot fizzbuzz excercise
===================================

FizzBuzz was popularized in programming circles by this post from Jeff Atwood http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html

The idea is you count from 1 to some number. If the number is evenly divisible by 3 you say "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5 you say "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you say "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

So the numbers from 1 to 20 would be read like so:
1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7,8,Fizz,Buzz,11,Fizz,13,14,FizzBuzz,16,17,Fizz,19,Buzz

Contribute your solution by adding a folder name {your twitter handle}+{your language} such as "bryan_hunter+erlang".

Enjoy.
